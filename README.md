# Visualize Data with a Heat Map

Data visualization project from FreeCodeCamp built using React and D3.

#### User stories:

1. I can view a heat map with data represented both on the Y and X axis.

2. Each cell is colored based its relationship to other data.

3. I can mouse over a cell in the heat map to get more exact information.
